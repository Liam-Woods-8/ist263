        <h2>Python Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Python was the first language I learned at Syracuse University through
          my CIS 151 course. I was able to immediately fall in love with the
          language due to my amazing professor and the simplicity of the
          language. Outside of coding in class time, this was the first language
          I explored and made personal projects with, my favorite being the
          snake game.

        <h2>HTML/CSS Learning</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently enrolled in a class teaching me to use HTML/CSS which
          is greatly assisting me in clearing up what I learned over the summer
          when I learned the language through a brief online course. I really
          enjoy HTML and CSS since it enables me to explore my creative side of
          coding. I hope to further my skills by combining my knowledge of
          JavaScript and HTML/CSS to create websites for local businesses in my
          area.

        <h2>JavaScript Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Learned JavaScript as my first coding language through AP computer
          science principles which I took my senior year of high school. This is
          what convinced me to continue exploring potential careers in coding
          and what led me to the major I am studying today. Creating
          applications and websites using JavaScript made me realize coding also
          entails creativity.
