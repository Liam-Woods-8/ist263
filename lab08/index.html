    <h1>Liam Woods Biography</h1>
    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Liam Woods, I am a Innovation Society and Technology major at
      Syracuse University’s information studies college. I’m interested in using
      data analytics and my large variety of tech skills to work for motorsport
      groups like formula 1. I’m skilled in <strong>Python</strong>, have
      knowledge in JavaScript, and am currently learning HTML. Outside of work
      I’m very passionate about Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, I enjoy watching formula 1,
      and I always look forward to seeing friends and family back in Brazil.
