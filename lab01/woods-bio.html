    My name is Liam Woods, I am a Innovation Society and Technology major at
    Syracuse University’s information studies college. I’m interested in using
    data analytics and my large variety of tech skills to work for motorsport
    groups like formula 1. I’m skilled in Python, have knowledge in JavaScript,
    and am currently learning HTML. Outside of work I’m very passionate about
    Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, I enjoy watching formula 1, and I always look forward
    to seeing friends and family back in Brazil.
